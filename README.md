- rising action: issues about current color schems
		- eye strain
		- hard to see the screen when the sun is brightest or when on the balcony
		- problems with dark colors schemes in broad daylight
		- bad sleep quality due to being too much in front 
		- circadian impact of computer monitors
		- illnesses related to the distribution of circadian rhythm: stress, sleep problems. 

	- falling action: how does it solve the issues
		- changing colors dynamically do adapt the time of day
		- solves eye strain by using the adequate contrast level
		- changes contrast to adapt to the daylight environment
		- Avoid distribution of sleep by reducing blue light in the evening
		- Increase focus by boosting blue light during the day


## How does the Kumux color scheme work?

The Kumux color scheme is a dynamic circadian color scheme that imitates and adapts to natural light
in order to provide health benefits.

The color scheme uses Kumux's Human Centric Lighting technology. It follows the sun through the
day and dynamically adapts the colors in your editor.

Uses geoLocation based on your timezone to determine the position and trajectory of the sun

## How effective is Kumux color scheme?

Using the Kumux color scheme it is possible to reach the recommended values for a healthy light exposure.
Calibrated measurements have been taken in different scenarios and it has been found that it is possible to provide the state of the art scientific values as described in the paper "Recommendations for healthy daytime, evening, and night-time indoor light exposure" [1]
This color scheme is under continuous development and new configurations are being explored to obtain optimized results.
